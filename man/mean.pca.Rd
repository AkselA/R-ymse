\title{PCA mean}
\usage{
\method{mean}{pca}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{PCA objects, or a single list of PCA objects}
}
\description{
Takes the average of several PCA objects
}
\details{
I don't know if this sort of calculation has any kind of merit. It was
written more as an excercise than as a solution to a problem

\examples{
xx <- data.frame(bee=c(0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 3), 
                wasp=c(1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1), 
                  fly=c(1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0),
              beetle=c(1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2))

set.seed(1)
xxl <- replicate(1000, {
	xx$random <- sample(c(0:1, 0:4), 8, r=TRUE)
