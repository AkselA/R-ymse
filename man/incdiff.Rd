\title{Increase difference}
\usage{
incdiff(x, step = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric sequence}

\item{step}{how long a step the difference is considered for.}
}
\description{
Rearrange a sorted numeric sequence so that the difference between subsequent 
elements is increased
}
\details{
With \code{step=2} (default) only the difference between immediate neighbours are
considered; the difference between every second element will remain small, 
or rather reduced, compared to the original sequence. With \code{step=3} say, 
differences of both lag 1 and 2 is increased, but the difference of lag 1 will
be less than if a step of 2 was used.
}
\examples{
x <- 1:100
diff(x)

diff(incdiff(x, 2))
diff(incdiff(x, 3))

diff(incdiff(x, 2), 2)
diff(incdiff(x, 3), 2)

# incdiff will introduce a periodicity equal to the step length
acf(incdiff(x, 10))

# useful for making a sequence of colours more distinct
y <- seq(0.4, 1, l=18)
cols1 <- hsv(y, 1, y)
cols2 <- hsv(y, 1, incdiff(y, 3))

plot(y, col=cols1, pch=16, cex=5, ylim=c(0.4, 1.5))
points(y+0.5, col=cols2, pch=16, cex=5)
}
